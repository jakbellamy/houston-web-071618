# Redux Review

## Vocabulary Terms

- Container Component

- Presentational Component

- connect

- mapStateToProps

- mapDispatchToProps


## Best Practices

- Plan what visual components we need

- Plan what our state (variable data) should look like by defining a default state 

- Start by keeping your action creators with their components

- Start by keeping action types as strings

- When you Fetch, dispatch one action to start the fetch, when you get a response from the server dispatch another action

- Only access localstorage inside your store file

- Format your data the same for both your auth and create user endpoints
